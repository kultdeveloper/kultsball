# Kult's Ball
The most simplest Gorilla Tag mod I will probably make.
(My first Gorilla Tag mod)
##### What is this mod?
This mod contains a ball that spawns in Forest when you join a Modded Lobby in Gorila Tag.
The ball is pushable and client-sided.
##### Why this mod?
Who doesn't love a random ball to play around with?
I know I certainly love balls.
# How To Use:
1. Enter a Modded Lobby ([Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla/releases) to get those).
2. Enjoy touching that ball.
# Installation:
1. Get the latest Release from [Releases](https://github.com/kultdeveloper/kultsball/releases/)
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Drag the folder "plugins" into your BepInEx folder
4. Start the game!
# Requirements:
- [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla/releases) - Only use is modded lobbies and nothing else lol.
